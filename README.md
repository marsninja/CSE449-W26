# Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence

## Principles and Practice of Virtual Assistant AI

**EECS 449, Fall 2026**

# 

# Summary

The science and art of creating real modern generative AI systems and products spans multiple areas in computer science. Learning about and leveraging advances in these areas to create state-of-the applications leveraging generative and agentic AI is the central focus of this course. Throughout the course, students will put into practice the end-to-end creation of an agentic software solution leveraging modern GenAI models and prompted contextual agentic software engineering. Students will also use the Jac and Jaseci open source ecosystem and tooling that comprises of and supersets popular modern tooling (React, Javascript/Typescript, Python, FastAPI, and k8s) along with cutting edge agentic AI technologies (ByLLM, etc). Students will be inventing their own products, building them out end to end, and actually launching them to end users in the span of one semester. The project culminates in a marketing campaign to the world and demo day at Michigan where creations are shared for others to try. 

In the creation of these virtual assistants, students will form groups of around \~4-5 students to select a use case, design the agentic workflows, train AI capabilities if needed, implement logic, and execute the end to end build out and integration into an existing public API. In class, students will learn about the broad landscape of NLP and Conversational AI from it’s fundamental principles. Students will also learn state of the art techniques for various aspects of modeling language in deep learning, leveraging  transfer learning to solve NLP problem, and gain very important experience understanding and interpreting research papers as the state of the art evolves. As an MDE, the grading of the course is predominantly project-based and students will be presenting the evolution of their project in course. Also students will gain valuable experience presenting technical ideas and evaluation through 2 presentations per group.

# What to Expect This Semester

This course is designed to embody real-world AI product development. You are not completing assignments for a grade, you are building something real, working in teams, managing ambiguity, making tradeoffs, and launching publicly. The goal is for every student to finish the semester having built, shipped, and marketed a real AI product.

This course and its associated funding for project launches are made possible through funding from the National Science Foundation and University of Michigan, providing students with a unique opportunity to build, ship, and market real AI products at scale.

This course is structured as a hands-on, project-based experience centered on building and launching a real AI product using a cutting-edge open-source AI ecosystem.

* Students will be organized into project teams of 4–5 members.  
* Each team will design, build, and launch a complete end-to-end AI product, not a toy example.  
* All projects will be built on the Jaseci and Jac open-source ecosystem, which:  
  * Supersets and integrates modern industry tooling such as React, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, FastAPI, and Kubernetes (k8s)  
  * Enables rapid development of agentic AI systems using advanced capabilities such as ByLLM and related AI-native abstractions  
* Teams will have full ownership of their project, including product vision, technical design, and execution decisions.   
* All projects will be publicly launched toward the end of the semester. Each team will design and execute a digital marketing campaign for their product.

# Notes

* **MVP Pitch Week (Week 10)** — This is where launch grants are awarded, ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars based on the quality and potential of your product. Come prepared to impress. This funding is thanks due to the NSF POSE program. 

* **Launch Week (Week 12)** — Go live. This is when you push the button on your digital marketing campaign and release your product to real users.

* **Reflection Week (Week 15)** — A recap of the semester: what you built, what worked, what you learned, and what you'd do differently.

* **Weekly Updates** — Each group update should be 3–5 slides covering your progress, blockers, and next steps.

# Tips for the Journey

* **Design early** — Use any tool (Figma, Canva, whiteboard, napkin sketch, etc.). The tool doesn't matter, starting does. Having a visual reference early aligns your team on what you're building and saves you from costly mid-semester pivots. Don't overthink it — a rough wireframe beats no wireframe every time.

* **Identify your hook** — Decide on the one standout feature you'll market first. Lead with what grabs attention. This is the feature that makes someone stop scrolling and say "I want to try that." Your marketing campaign will revolve around it, so pick something compelling and make sure it works flawlessly.

* **Nail the happy path** — Define the golden end-to-end workflow and make it rock-solid before branching out. Map the exact steps a user takes from opening your product to getting value out of it. That core flow should feel seamless. Edge cases and extra features come later, if your happy path is broken, nothing else matters.

* **Build early, build often** — Don't wait until the design is perfect. Get code running as soon as possible. A working prototype with rough edges teaches you more than a polished spec that hasn't been tested. You'll discover the real problems (and the real opportunities) only once something is running.

* **Ship something every week** — Aim to have a working version at all times, no matter how rough. Treat every Monday update as a mini-launch. This forces incremental progress, keeps your team accountable, and means you're never more than a week away from a demo-ready state. The teams that ship weekly are the ones that launch successfully.


# Grading

This is a very ‘do based’ course as opposed to ‘study based’. A significant portion of the grade is allocated to the projects. Lets build some amazing stuff\! 😊

**Team-Based Components (70%)**

- Technical implementation and AI integration (Codebase, agentic AI, system design): 20%  
- Product design, usability, and completeness: 10%  
- In-semester group update presentations (slides, demos, clarity, progress): 15%  
- Digital marketing campaign strategy and execution: 10%  
- Final launch quality, public release, and final presentation/demo: 15%


**Individual Components (30%)** 

- 10 Weekly individual reflection submissions: 3% each  
  * All, half, or nothing based clarity, technical substance, honesty, and demonstrated engagement

**Additional Extra Credit Opportunity**: Up to 20% Extra Credit 

# Logistics and Details

**Late Policy**

The official policy is Late work will not be accepted under any circumstances. That being said if I do make case by case determinations sometimes, though there are no guarantees. 

**Github**

Students will be engaging open source software and the open source community in this course. You will need to have a free github account if you don’t already. You are allowed to make your repositories public and share your code with anyone in the class throughout. 

**MDE Project**

This course will have a large team­based project that will require designing and building an end to end software. After group formation, an initial ‘pitch’ document and in­class presentation will help teams get feedback on their ideas. After that, there will be a few milestones on the way to a final project document, presentation, and demos. The objective of this project is to build a system from the ground up that work really well in practice. Be creative\! 

**Honor Code**

All students (including LS\&A and Engineering) are required to observe the Engineering Honor Code in all assignments and exams. A copy of the honor code can be found at http://ossa.engin.umich.edu/honor­council/. Please make sure that you clearly understand what constitutes cheating. If you are not sure in any specific case, you should ask the teaching staff.
